# Password_Strength_Checker
This Python program evaluates password strength by checking criteria like length, uppercase / lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It provides real-time feedback and allows users to retry until a secure password is created, reinforcing core data type manipulation (strings, lists) and conditional logic.
